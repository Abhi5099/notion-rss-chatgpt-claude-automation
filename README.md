# ðŸ§  Notion RSS â†’ ChatGPT & Claude Automation

## About
This automation creates a new Notion page for every new article triggered from an RSS feed. Each article is enriched using **Perplexity AI** and **Anthropic Claude**, making it easier to consume, organize, and manage content efficiently. This is perfect for content creators, researchers, and knowledge workers who want intelligent summaries and insights automatically stored in their workspace.
